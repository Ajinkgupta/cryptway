# Cryptway

Cryptway is the first version of our crypto transaction project. Instead of adding new versions to this, we created a separate repository: [Cryptway-ETH-Wallet](https://github.com/Ajinkgupta/Cryptway-ETH-Wallet).

In this version, we are not using any external wallet. Instead, we provide the option to create a new Ethereum wallet or recover an existing wallet using a private key, making it more user-friendly. For more information about the Cryptway project, visit @cryptway.
